/** @title Registry to deploy Hats.finance vaults and manage shared parameters
* @author hats.finance
* @notice Hats.finance is a proactive bounty protocol for white hat hackers
* and auditors, where projects, community members, and stakeholders
* incentivize protocol security and responsible disclosure.
* Hats create scalable vaults using the projectâ€™s own token. The value of the
* bounty increases with the success of the token and project.
*
* The HATVaultsRegistry defines a few roles which are relevant to all vaults:
* Governance - The owner of HATVaultsRegistry and every HATVault created, has
* the permission to set the feeSetter and arbitrator roles, to set time limits
* and bounty parameters and change vaults' info.
* Arbitrator - Can challenge submitted claims for bounty payouts, approve them
* with a different bounty percentage or dismiss them.
* FeeSetter - The only address which can set the fee on withdrawals on all
* vaults.
*
* This project is open-source and can be found at:
* https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts
