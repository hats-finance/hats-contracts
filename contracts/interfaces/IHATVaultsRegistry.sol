/** @title Interface for the Hats.finance Vault Registry
 * @author hats.finance
 * @notice The Hats.finance Vault Registry is used to deploy Hats.finance
 * vaults and manage shared parameters.
 *
 * Hats.finance is a proactive bounty protocol for white hat hackers and
 * security experts, where projects, community members, and stakeholders
 * incentivize protocol security and responsible disclosure.
 * Hats create scalable vaults using the projectâ€™s own token. The value of the
 * bounty increases with the success of the token and project.
 *
 * The owner of the registry has the permission to set time limits and bounty
 * parameters and change vaults' info, and to set the other registry roles -
 * fee setter and arbitrator.
 * The arbitrator can challenge submitted claims for bounty payouts made by
 * vaults' committees, approve them with a different bounty percentage or
 * dismiss them.
 * The fee setter can set the fee on withdrawals on all vaults.
 *
 * This project is open-source and can be found at:
 * https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts
 *
 * @dev New hats.finance vaults should be created through a call to {createVault}
 * so that they are linked to the registry
 */
