/** @title Interface for Hats.finance Vaults
 * @author Hats.finance
 * @notice A HATVault holds the funds for a specific project's bug bounties.
 * Anyone can permissionlessly deposit into the HATVault using
 * the vaultâ€™s native token. When a bug is submitted and approved, the bounty 
 * is paid out using the funds in the vault. Bounties are paid out as a
 * percentage of the vault. The percentage is set according to the severity of
 * the bug. Vaults have regular safety periods (typically for an hour twice a
 * day) which are time for the committee to make decisions.
 *
 * In addition to the roles defined in the IHATVaultsRegistry, every HATVault 
 * has the roles:
 * Committee - The only address which can submit a claim for a bounty payout
 * and set the maximum bounty.
 * User - Anyone can deposit the vault's native token into the vault and 
 * recieve shares for it. Shares represent the user's relative part in the
 * vault, and when a bounty is paid out, users lose part of their deposits
 * (based on percentage paid), but keep their share of the vault.
 * Users also receive rewards for their deposits, which can be claimed at any
 *  time.
 * To withdraw previously deposited tokens, a user must first send a withdraw
 * request, and the withdrawal will be made available after a pending period.
 * Withdrawals are not permitted during safety periods or while there is an 
 * active claim for a bounty payout.
 *
 * Bounties are payed out distributed between a few channels, and that 
 * distribution is set upon creation (the hacker gets part in direct transfer,
 * part in vested reward and part in vested HAT token, part gets rewarded to
 * the committee, part gets swapped to HAT token and burned and/or sent to Hats
 * governance).
 *
 * NOTE: Vaults should not use tokens which do not guarantee that the amount
 * specified is the amount transferred
 *
 * This project is open-source and can be found at:
 * https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts
