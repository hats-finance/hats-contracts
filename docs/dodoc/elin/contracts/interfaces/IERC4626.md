# IERC4626







*Interface of the ERC4626 &quot;Tokenized Vault Standard&quot;, as defined in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626[ERC-4626]. _Available since v4.7._*

## Methods

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256)
```



*Returns the remaining number of tokens that `spender` will be allowed to spend on behalf of `owner` through {transferFrom}. This is zero by default. This value changes when {approve} or {transferFrom} are called.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| owner | address | undefined |
| spender | address | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | uint256 | undefined |

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external nonpayable returns (bool)
```



*Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the caller&#39;s tokens. Returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation succeeded. IMPORTANT: Beware that changing an allowance with this method brings the risk that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering. One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender&#39;s allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729 Emits an {Approval} event.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| spender | address | undefined |
| amount | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| _0 | bool | undefined |

### asset

```solidity
function asset() external view returns (address assetTokenAddress)
```



*Returns the address of the underlying token used for the Vault for accounting, depositing, and withdrawing. - MUST be an ERC-20 token contract. - MUST NOT revert.*


#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| assetTokenAddress | address | undefined |

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)
```



*Returns the amount of tokens owned by `account`.*

#### Parameters

|---|---|---|
| account | address | undefined |

### convertToAssets

```solidity
function convertToAssets(uint256 shares) external view returns (uint256 assets)
```



*Returns the amount of assets that the Vault would exchange for the amount of shares provided, in an ideal scenario where all the conditions are met. - MUST NOT be inclusive of any fees that are charged against assets in the Vault. - MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller. - MUST NOT reflect slippage or other on-chain conditions, when performing the actual exchange. - MUST NOT revert. NOTE: This calculation MAY NOT reflect the “per-user” price-per-share, and instead should reflect the “average-user’s” price-per-share, meaning what the average user should expect to see when exchanging to and from.*

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| shares | uint256 | undefined |

#### Returns

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| assets | uint256 | undefined |
