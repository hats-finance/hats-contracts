# IHATVaultsRegistry

*hats.finance*

> Interface for the Hats.finance Vault Registry

The Hats.finance Vault Registry is used to deploy Hats.finance vaults and manage shared parameters. Hats.finance is a proactive bounty protocol for white hat hackers and security experts, where projects, community members, and stakeholders incentivize protocol security and responsible disclosure. Hats create scalable vaults using the projectâ€™s own token. The value of the bounty increases with the success of the token and project. The owner of the registry has the permission to set time limits and bounty parameters and change vaults&#39; info, and to set the other registry roles - fee setter and arbitrator. The arbitrator can challenge submitted claims for bounty payouts made by vaults&#39; committees, approve them with a different bounty percentage or dismiss them. The fee setter can set the fee on withdrawals on all vaults. This project is open-source and can be found at: https://github.com/hats-finance/hats-contracts

*New hats.finance vaults should be created through a call to {createVault} so that they are linked to the registry*
