The Hats protocol is designed to give white hats hackers the opportunity to gain more on their good behaviour and contribution. Trying to tilt the balance of incentives, and incentivizing more hackers to act responsively. It is doing so by letting projects publish on-chain bounties for their protocols, with committees in-charge of approving or rejecting claims. To further increase the efficiency of this model, the HAT token is introduced, to help bootstrap both ends in this two-sided market.
